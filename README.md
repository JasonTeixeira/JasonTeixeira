Hi, I’m Jason. I specialize in building a wide variety of projects. Since every solution is unique, each project I work on includes a comprehensive guide on "How to Build" the foundational infrastructure, accompanied by supporting configurations to facilitate scalability and growth. These configurations are developed with careful consideration of key factors, including Security, Scalability, Reliability, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization. For those interested in the strategic rationale behind each project, I have provided detailed notes at the end of the page.

<summary><h3>Project Intentions</h3></summary>
<p>Projects are crucial for gaining practical, hands-on experience. From the outset of my cloud technology journey, I recognized that it wasn’t enough to simply understand how a service functions in isolation—I needed to see how it integrates within a broader, real-world context. With a business background, I fundamentally understand that technology should serve the business, not the other way around. This perspective naturally leads to designing systems with simplicity, efficiency, and purpose in mind. In an enterprise environment, every configuration change introduces numerous considerations—often exceeding a thousand—that must be meticulously evaluated.

The approach I’ve applied to my public projects mirrors how I would tackle real-world scenarios, always beginning with the business requirements. These include gaining a deep understanding of the business's operations, identifying its technological needs, ensuring compliance when handling customer data, safeguarding security, planning for scalability to accommodate millions of users, and developing a robust disaster recovery strategy. As expected, the list of considerations is comprehensive.

At a senior level, most architects' detailed system designs remain proprietary, with much of the work governed by internal agreements. Why is this worth noting? Because building systems from scratch is a specialized and complex endeavor. While many systems share common components, no two are exactly alike, as each business has unique requirements. This is why new hires often spend their initial months familiarizing themselves with the company’s architectural and technical documentation.

I am continually developing private repositories, which I will release when they become applicable for real-world application. My focus has always been to design each project within a business context, prioritizing the organization's needs. A notable challenge, however, is documenting these systems within a universally accepted framework—something that doesn’t yet exist. Each company typically documents its systems in slightly different ways. For consistency, I have adopted the TOGAF framework, which I find offers both the structure and flexibility to accommodate various inputs.

For every project I publish, I strive to go beyond the technical deliverables by providing an extensive list of critical considerations. These are categorized and evaluated against a range of key factors. My goal is for anyone engaging with my projects—whether for learning or professional purposes—to understand that these considerations are ever-present, even if not explicitly detailed in every instance.

If you're interested, feel free to visit my blog, where I share my projects, thought experiments, and the common challenges I encounter, along with my approaches to addressing them.
